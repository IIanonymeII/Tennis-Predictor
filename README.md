# Prediction Betting (ATP & WTA)



### Overview
This project focuses on predicting betting outcomes for ATP and WTA tennis matches using historical match data and betting odds. It provides a comprehensive pipeline for data preparation, model development, and evaluation, leveraging modern tools and best practices for robust and maintainable code.

### Key Features  

- **Dependency Management**:  
  Uses **Poetry** to create reproducible environments and handle dependencies effortlessly.  

- **Testing**:  
  - **Static Type Checking**: Ensures type safety with `mypy`.  
  - **Unit Testing**: Validates functionality with `pytest`.  

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:  
  Automates testing and validation using **GitHub Actions**, maintaining consistent code quality.  

- **Documentation**:  
  Provides clear and concise guidelines for setup, usage, and contribution.

## 📂 Raw Data
The `data/` directory stores unmodified raw data exactly as collected from external sources (web scraping, APIs, downloads, etc.). These files remain untouched to ensure reproducibility and traceability.

* Location: `data/`
* Subfolders:
    * `atptour_raw/`    → ATP Tour data for each player (birthday, height, turn pro, hand, backhand)
    * `flashscore_raw/` → Flashscore match and odds data (tournaments, matches, players, rankings, etc.)
    * `wikipedia_raw/`  → tournament historical info, etc.

These act as the ground truth reference for the project.
